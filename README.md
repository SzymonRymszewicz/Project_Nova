# Project_Nova
  
Project Nova is a python app where you can create and interact with bots. This program uses what I like to call the TKAEM system, meaning the Tiered Keyword and Embedding Memory system. This makes even high context bots have dynamic human-like memory and thought processing modules. This app does not provide an API and works only as an interface(similar to Silly Tavern). You can use a localhost or connect to your preferred API in order to interact with the bot.

I will not take any responsibility for what you do with this app. The LLM's and bots outputs in general are dependant on their definition and most importantly, the user input. I have not control or means to control what you do locally with this app.

If you like what I create, consider supporting me by buying me a coffee ;)
