# Project_Nova
  
<p>Project Nova is a python program where you can create and interact with bots. This program uses what I like to call the TKAEM system, meaning the Tiered Keyword and Embedding Memory system. This makes even high context bot have dynamic human like memory and thought processing modules.

If you like what I create consider supporting me by buying me a coffee ;)
