# Project_Nova
  
Project Nova is a python program where you can create and interact with bots. This program uses what I like to call the TKAEM system, meaning the Tiered Keyword and Embedding Memory system. This makes even high context bots have dynamic human-like memory and thought processing modules. This code does not provide an API and works only as an interface(similar to Silly Tavern). You can use a localhost or connect to your preferred API in order to interact with the bot.

If you like what I create, consider supporting me by buying me a coffee ;)
